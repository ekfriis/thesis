\label{ch:conclusions}

This analysis has presented a search for MSSM Higgs bosons in the 2010 7~\TeV
CMS data set.  The search was performed using 36~\pbinv of data.  The expected
event yield from Standard Model sources is 425 events. In total, 413 events were
selected; the observed is compatible with the Standard Model.  No signal--like
excess of events is observed.
