\section{Particle Identification}
\subsection{Muons}
\label{sec:MuonId}

Muon candidates are required to be global muons and to pass the VBTF muon
identification criteria~\cite{CMS-PAS-EWK-10-002}.

The muons are required to be isolated with respect to charged hadrons of $\pt >
1.0~\GeVc$ and photons of $\pt > 1.5~\GeVc$ as reconstructed by the
particle--flow algorithm~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001} in a cone of size $\Delta R =
0.4$ around the direction of the muon.

\section{Event Selections}
The selections applied to the analysis are designed to reject large fractions of
the background while maintaining a high efficiency for identifying signal
(Higgs) events.  The backgrounds can be divided into two classifications:
``fake'' backgrounds, in which there is at least one misidentified hadronic tau
decay, and the irreducible $Z\to\TT$ background, which cannot\footnote{Due to
the differences in spin between the $Z$ (spin~1) and the Higgs (spin~0), it
maybe be possible to separate the two using spin correlations of the two tau
decays.} be distinguished from the potential presence of a Higgs boson of the
same mass.  Strategies for dealing with the irreducible $Z$ background will be
discussed in the Chapter~\ref{ch:results}.
The different fake backgrounds, their cross section, and the basic 
removal strategies are outlined in Table~\ref{tab:FakeBackgrounds}.

Events in the muon plus tau--jet channel are selected by requiring a muon of
$\pt^{\mu} > 15$~\GeVc within $ \left| \eta_{\mu} \right| < 2.1$ and a tau-jet
candidate of $\pt^{\tau\mbox{--jet}} > 20$~\GeVc within $ \left|
\eta_{\tau\mbox{--jet}} \right| < 2.3$. The muon and tau--jet candidate are
required to be of opposite charge, as expected for the $\ZTT$ signal.  The muon
is required to be reconstructed as global muon and pass the VBTF muon
identification criteria~\cite{CMS-PAS-EWK-10-002}. Furthermore, the muon is required to
be isolated with respect to charged hadrons of $\pt > 1.0$~\GeVc and neutral
electromagnetic objects of $\pt > 1.5$~\GeVc (reconstructed by the
particle--flow algorithm) within a cone of size $\Delta R = 0.4$ around the muon
direction.  The tau-jet candidate is required to pass the ``medium'' TaNC tau
identification discriminator.

Additional event selection criteria are applied to reduce contributions of
background processes. $Z \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ background contributions
are largely due to muons which failed to get reconstructed as global muons and
are misidentified as tau--jet candidates. These muons are typically isolated and
have a large chance to pass the TaNC tau ID discriminators.  In order to reject
this background, a dedicated discriminator against muons is
applied~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-08-001}. Residual muon background is suppressed by
rejecting tau-jet candidates which have a track of $\pt > 15~\GeV$ and for which
the sum of energy deposits in ECAL plus HCAL is below $0.25 \cdot P$ within a
cylinder of of radius $15$~\centi\meter (ECAL) and $25$~\centi\meter (HCAL),
respectively.  The $\ttbar$, \WpJets and QCD multi--jet backgrounds are
suppressed by cuts on the transverse mass and the \Pzeta variable.
Contamination from $Z \to \TT$ events in which the reconstructed tau--jet
candidate is due to a $\tau \to e \nu \nu$ decay is reduced by applying a
dedicated tau ID discriminator against electrons.

The complete set of event selection criteria applied in the muon +
tau--jet channel are summarized in table~\ref{tab:AHtoMuTauEventSelection}.

The events are triggered by a combination of muon and muon + tau--jet
``cross--channel'' triggers. For the muon triggers, paths with lowest $P_{T}$
thresholds are used as long as the path remained unprescaled (see
table~\ref{tab:AHtoMuTauTriggers}). 
The muon + tau--jet ``cross--channel'' trigger paths increase the trigger efficiency for
events containing muons of transverse momenta close to the
$P_{T}^{\mu} > 15$~\GeV cut threshold.
The trigger efficiency is measured in data via the tag--and--probe
technique. Details of the muon trigger efficiency measurement are
given in section~\ref{sec:ZmumuTagAndProbe} of the appendix.
Monte Carlo simulated events are required to pass the
HLT\_Mu9 trigger path. Weights are applied to simulated events to account for the
difference between the simulated HLT\_Mu9 efficiency and the combined
efficiency of the set HLT\_Mu9, HLT\_IsoMu9, HLT\_Mu11, HLT\_IsoMu13,
HLT\_Mu15, HLT\_IsoMu9\_PFTau15 and HLT\_Mu11\_PFTau15 used to trigger
the data.
