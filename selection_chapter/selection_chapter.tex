\chapter{Analysis Selections} \label{ch:selections}
%
The selections applied to data in this analysis are designed to maximize the
significance of Higgs signal events in the final set of selected events.  This
analysis presented in this thesis is an inclusive analysis, meaning that no
preference is given to any single Higgs production mechanism.  The analysis
looks specifically at the channel in which one tau decays to a muon and the
other decays to hadrons.  Therefore the first step in the analysis selection is
to find High Level Trigger selection that is highly efficiency for our signal
and is not highly prescaled\footnote{If a trigger has high background rates, it
may exceed its rate budget with increasing luminosity.  When this happens, it is
generally ``prescaled,'' and some fraction of the events that pass this
trigger are randomly thrown it away to reduce the rate.  In general, it is
better to select an unprescaled trigger with lower efficiency than a prescaled
trigger.}.  After the trigger selection, events are required to contain at least
a good muon and a good tau.  Vetoes on extra leptons are applied to reduce
backgrounds from di--muon events.  Finally, kinematic and charge selections on
the are applied to the event to reduce \WpJets and QCD backgrounds.

\section{High Level Trigger}
As only data which passes the HLT is recorded, it is thus critical that an
appropriate trigger path is found. The events in this analysis are
triggered by a combination of muon and muon + tau--jet ``cross--channel''
triggers. For the muon triggers, paths with lowest \pt thresholds are used as
long as the path remained unprescaled (see Table~\ref{tab:AHtoMuTauTriggers}).
The muon + tau--jet ``cross--channel'' trigger paths increase the trigger
efficiency for events containing muons of transverse momenta close to the
$\pt^{\mu} > 15$~\GeVc cut threshold.  The trigger efficiency is measured in
data via the tag--and--probe technique. Details of the muon trigger efficiency
measurement are given in Section~\ref{sec:ZmumuTagAndProbe}.  Monte Carlo
simulated events are required to pass the HLT\_Mu9 trigger path. Weights are
applied to simulated events to account for the difference between the simulated
HLT\_Mu9 efficiency and the combined efficiency of the set HLT\_Mu9,
HLT\_IsoMu9, HLT\_Mu11, HLT\_IsoMu13, HLT\_Mu15, HLT\_IsoMu9\_PFTau15 and
HLT\_Mu11\_PFTau15 used to trigger the data.

\section{Particle Identification}
\subsection{Muons}
\label{sec:MuonId}

Muon candidates are required to be reconstructed as global and as tracker muons,
meaning that a full track is reconstructed in the muon system and is well
matched to a track in the silicon strip and pixel trackers.
Additionally, they are required to pass the ``Vector Boson Task Force'' (VBTF)
muon identification criteria developed for the $Z \to \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$
cross--section measurement~\cite{CMS-PAS-EWK-10-002}:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\geq 1$ Pixel hits
\item $\geq 10$ hits in silicon Pixel $+$ Strip detectors
\item $\geq 1$ hit(s) in muon system
\item $\geq 2$ matched segments
\item $\chi^{2}/DoF < 10$ for global track fit
\item transverse impact parameter of ``inner'' track $d_\text{IP} < 2~\milli\meter$
  with respect to beam--spot
\end{itemize}

In order to reduce background contributions from muons originating from heavy
quark decays in QCD multi--jet events, muons are required to be isolated.
Isolation is computed as the \pt sum of charged and neutral hadrons plus photons
reconstructed by the CMS particle--flow algorithm~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001} within a
cone of size $\Delta R_{iso} = 0.4$ around the muon direction.  The innermost
region of size $\Delta R_{veto} = 0.08$ ($0.05$) is excluded from the
computation of the isolation \pt sum with respect to neutral hadrons (photons),
in order to avoid energy deposits in the electromagnetic and hadronic
calorimeters which are due to the muon to enter the sum.  In order to reduce
pile--up effects, particles entering the isolation \pt sum are required to have
transverse momenta $\pt > 1.0$~\GeVc.  Charged particles are additionally
required to originate from the same vertex as the muon.  The muons are required
to be isolated with respect to charged hadrons of $\pt > 1.0~\GeVc$ and photons
of $\pt > 1.5~\GeVc$ as reconstructed by the particle--flow
algorithm~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001} in a cone of size $\Delta R = 0.4$ around
the direction of the muon.

\subsection{Hadronic Taus}

Hadronic decays of taus are identified by the \hpsTanc hybrid algorithm
described in Section~\ref{sec:TauId}.  The ``medium'' working point is used,
corresponding to an expected QCD fake--rate of about 1\%. $Z \to \MM$ background
contributions are largely due to muons which failed to get reconstructed as
global muons (thus failing the muon identification requirement) and are
misidentified as tau--jet candidates.  These muons are typically isolated and
have a large chance to pass the hadronic tau ID discriminators.  To reject these
events, hadronic taus are additionally required to pass an anti--muon veto
described in Section~\ref{sec:LightLeptonRejection}. 

\subsection{Missing Transverse Energy}

The missing transverse energy \MET, in the event is reconstructed based on the
vectorial momentum sum of particle candidates reconstructed by the
particle--flow algorithm~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001, CMS-PAS-JME-10-005}.  In the
ideal case, the \MET corresponds to the vector sum of the transverse components
of all neutrinos in the event.  The \MET resolution in simulated $Z\to\MM$
events is found to be smaller (better) than in the data.   The reconstructed
\MET in the simulated events is ``smeared'' by a correction factor such that the
data and simulation are in agreement.  The ``Z--recoil'' \MET correction
procedure is described in Section~\ref{sec:ZRecoilCorr}.

\section{Event Selections}
The selections applied to the analysis are designed to reject large fractions of
the background while maintaining a high efficiency for identifying signal
(Higgs) events.  The backgrounds can be divided into two classifications:
``fake'' backgrounds, in which there is at least one misidentified hadronic tau
decay, and the irreducible $Z\to\TT$ background, which cannot\footnote{Due to
the differences in spin between the $Z$ (spin~1) and the Higgs (spin~0), it
maybe be possible to separate the two using spin correlations of the two tau
decays.} be distinguished from the potential presence of a Higgs boson of the
same mass.  Strategies for dealing with the irreducible $Z$ background will be
discussed in the Chapter~\ref{ch:results}.
The different fake backgrounds, their cross section, and the basic 
removal strategies are outlined in Table~\ref{tab:FakeBackgrounds}.
\begin{table}[t]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Background & Cross Section (\pb) \\
\hline
QCD Heavy Flavor &  84679\footnote{The QCD cross section given here is after a
requirement that at least one muon with $\pt > 15~\GeVc$ is produced in the
event.} \\
$W \to \mu \nu + \text{jets}$ & 10435 \\
$Z \to \mu \mu + \text{jets}$ & 1666  \\
$\ttbar + \text{jets}$ & 158 \\

\end{table}

Events are selected by requiring a muon of
$\pt^{\mu} > 15$~\GeVc within $ \left| \eta_{\mu} \right| < 2.1$ and a tau-jet
candidate of $\pt^{\tau\mbox{--jet}} > 20$~\GeVc within $ \left|
\eta_{\tau\mbox{--jet}} \right| < 2.3$.  The $\eta$ requirement on the muon
ensures that it is within the fiducial region of the muon trigger system.  The
$\eta$ requirement on the hadronic tau ensures it is well within the fiducial
region of the tracker ($|\eta| < 2.5$) and minimizes exposure to large QCD
backgrounds in the very forward region.

The muon and tau--jet candidate are required to be of opposite charge, as the
Higgs is neutral and charge is conserved.  The muon is required to be pass the
identification criteria described in Section~\ref{sec:MuonId}.   The tau-jet
candidate is required to pass the ``loose'' TaNC tau identification discriminator. 

Additional event selection criteria are applied to reduce contributions of
specific background processes. In order to reject this background, a dedicated
discriminator against muons is applied~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-08-001}. Remaining muon
background is suppressed by rejecting events which have a track of $\pt >
15~\GeVc$ and for which the sum of energy deposits in ECAL plus HCAL is below
$0.25 \cdot P$ within a cylinder of of radius $15$~\centi\meter (ECAL) and
$25$~\centi\meter (HCAL), respectively.  
Contamination from $Z \to \TT$ events in which the
reconstructed tau--jet candidate is due to a $\tau \to e \nu \nu$ decay is
reduced by applying a dedicated tau ID discriminator against electrons.

The $\ttbar$ and \WpJets backgrounds
are suppressed by cuts on the transverse mass of the $\mu--\MET$ system and the
\Pzeta variable.  The transverse mass ($M_T$) cut is defined as the quantity
\begin{equation}
  M_T = \pt^\mu \MET \sqrt{1 - \cos \Delta\phi},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta\phi$ is the angle between the muon and the reconstructed
$\vec{\MET}$ in the transverse plane.  The $M_T$ quantity is much higher in
events $W \to \mu \nu$ decays than in signal Higgs events.  In $W \to \mu \nu$
decays, the neutrino expected to be produced in the opposite to the muon in
azimuth.  In signal events, there are three neutrinos produced, with the
majority (two) of the neutrinos being associated to the $\tau \to \mu \nu \nu$
decay.  Accordingly, we expect that the \MET is on average collinear with the
muon in signal events.

The \Pzeta variable is another quantity with discriminant power against \WpJets
and \ttbar backgrounds.  The observable has been introduced in the search for
$H\to\TT$ events performed by the CDF collaboration~\cite{CDFrefPzeta}.  The
observable is motivated by the fact that in $\TT$ signal events all neutrinos
are produced in direction very close of the visible decay products of one of the
two tau leptons. It is therefore expected that the direction of the missing
transverse energy vector in these events point in a direction somewhere between
the visible $\tau$--lepton decay products. This event topology is not preferred
in $W$ + jets, $t\bar{t}$ and QCD background events.  The observable is computed
as difference of the projections:
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{\zeta} &= \vec{P}_{T}^{vis_{1}} + \vec{P}_{T}^{vis_{2}} + \MET \nonumber \\
P_{\zeta}^{vis} &= \vec{P}_{T}^{vis_{1}} + \vec{P}_{T}^{vis_{2}} 
\label{eq:PZetaEq}
\end{eqnarray}
on the axis $\zeta$ bisecting the directions $\vec{P}_{T}^{vis_{1}}$ and
$\vec{P}_{T}^{vis_{2}}$ of the visible $\tau$ lepton decay products in the
transverse plane (see Figure~\ref{fig:PzetaDefinition} for illustration).
