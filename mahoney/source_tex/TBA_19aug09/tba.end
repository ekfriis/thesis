\@doendnote{endnote17}{Compared to other information-theoretic measures of organization, $ {\protect \bf  E}$ is the most general, being the ``all-point'' mutual information \cite {Crut01a}. Of the alternative measures of stored information, $ {C_\mu }$ is the most general since the $\epsilon $\protect \nobreakdash -machine, from which it is derived, is a minimal sufficient statistic for a process \cite {CompMechMerge}.}
\@doendnote{endnote18}{As noted for human language\protect \nobreakspace  {}\cite {Ebel94c,Debo08a}, $ {\protect \bf  E}$ and $C_\mu $ can diverge. Using methods developed to analyze infinite $\epsilon $\protect \nobreakdash -machines\protect \nobreakspace  {}\cite {Crut01a,CompMechMerge}, we will report extensions of the present results to such cases elsewhere.}
