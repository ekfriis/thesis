This thesis describes a search for the Higgs boson, a new particle predicted by
a theory called the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM).  The Standard Model of
particle physics, the MSSM and Higgs phenomenology are introduced briefly. The
search presented in this thesis uses a single final state configuration, in
which the Higgs boson two tau leptons, with one tau decaying to a muon and
neutrinos,  and the other decays to pions and a single neutrino.  Two new
methods used in this analysis, the Tau Neural Classifier tau identification
algorithm, and the Secondary Vertex fit tau pair mass reconstruction method.
Both methods are discussed in detail.  The analysis uses the 2010 dataset from
the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, which contains 36~\pbinv of
integrated luminosity at a center of mass energy of 7~\TeV.  In total, 413
events are selected in the analysis; this value is compatible with the Standard
Model expectation.  No excess of signal events is observed, and we set an upper
limit on cross section times branching ratio of a Higgs boson.   We interpret
this limit in the parameter space of the MSSM.
