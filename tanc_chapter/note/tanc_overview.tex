The Tau Neural Classifier algorithm reconstructs the decay mode of the
tau candidate and then feeds the tau candidate to a discriminator associated
to that decay mode to make the classification decision.  Each discriminator
therefore maps to a reconstructed decay mode in a one-to-one fashion.  To
optimize the discrimination for each of the different decay modes, the TaNC uses
an ensemble of neural nets.  Each neural net corresponds to one of the dominant
hadronic decay modes of the tau lepton.  These selected hadronic decays
constitute 95\% of all hadronic tau decays.  Tau candidates with reconstructed
decay modes not in the set of dominant hadronic modes are immediately tagged as
background.
