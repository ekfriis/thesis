Each neural network corresponds to a different decay mode topology and as such
each network uses different observables as inputs.  However, many of the input
observables are used in multiple neural nets.  The superset of all observables
is listed and defined below. Table~\ref{tab:nn_var_table} maps the input
observables to their associated neural networks.  
%The signal and background
%distributions of the input observables for tau candidates in the training
%sample are shown in appendix~\ref{sec:input_descriptions}.  
In three prong
decays, the definition of the ``main track'' is important.  The main track
corresponds to the track with charge opposite to that of the total charge of the
three tracks.  This distinction is made to facilitate the use of the ``Dalitz''
observables, allowing identification of intermediate resonances in three--body
decays.  This is motivated by the fact that the three prong decays of the tau
generally proceed through $\tau^{-} \to a_1^{-} \nu_\tau \rightarrow
\pi^{-} \rho^0 \nu_\tau \to \pi^{-} \pi^{+} \pi^{-} \nu_\tau$; the
oppositely charged track can always be identified with the $\rho^0$ decay.
