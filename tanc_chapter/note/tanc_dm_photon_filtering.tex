Photons from the underlying event and other reconstruction effects cause the
number of reconstructed photons to be greater than the true number of photons
expected from a given hadronic tau decay.  Photons that have not been merged into
a $\pi^0$ meson candidate are recursively filtered by requiring that the
fraction of the transverse momentum carried by the lowest $P_T$ photon be
greater than 10\% with respect to the entire (tracks, $\pi^0$ candidates, and
photons) tau--candidate. In the case that a photon is not merged but meets the
minimum momentum fraction requirement, it is considered a $\pi^0$
candidate.  This requirement removes extraneous photons, while minimizing the
removal of single photons that correspond to a true $\pi^0$ meson
(see~\ref{fig:photonFiltering}). A mass hypothesis with the
nominal~\cite{PDG} value of the $\pi^0$ is applied to all $\pi^0$ candidates.
All objects that fail the filtering requirements are moved to the isolation
collection.

   \caption{Fraction of total $\tau$-candidate transverse momenta carried by the
   photon for reconstructed taus containing a single photons for two benchmark
   cases.  On the left, the reconstructed tau--candidate is matched to generator
   level $\tau^{-} \rightarrow \pi^{-}\nu_\tau$ decays, for which no photon is
   expected.  On the right, the reconstructed tau--candidate is matched to
   generator level $\tau^{-} \rightarrow \pi^{-}\pi^0\nu_\tau$ decays and the
   photon is expected to correspond to a true $\pi^0$ meson.  The requirement on
   the $P_T$ fraction of the lowest $P_T$ photon improves the purity of the
   decay mode reconstruction.  } \label{fig:photonFiltering}
