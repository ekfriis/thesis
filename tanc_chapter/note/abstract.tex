The Tau Neural Classifier (TaNC) is a novel algorithm for identification of
hadronic tau decays.  The algorithm includes two components, the reconstruction
of tau lepton hadronic decay modes and discrimination of tau lepton hadronic
decays from quark and gluon jets.  The reconstruction of decay modes is based
on the reconstruction of individual charged hadrons and photons by the
particle--flow algorithm and is utilized in the discrimination to train a set
of neural networks using input variables that are sensitive to particular decay
modes.  We observe a significant improvement in identification performance in
comparison to previous algorithms.
