\chapter{Tau Identification: The Tau Neural Classifier}
\label{ch:tanc}

\section{Introduction}

High tau identification performance is important for the discovery potential of
many possible new physics signals at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS).  The
Standard Model background rates from true tau leptons are typically the same
order of magnitude as the expected signal rate in many searches for new
physics.  The challenge of doing physics with taus is driven by the rate at
which objects are incorrectly tagged as taus.  In particular, quark and gluon
jets have a significantly higher production cross-section and events where
these objects are incorrectly identified as tau leptons can dominate the
backgrounds of searches for new physics using taus.  Efficient identification
of hadronic tau decays and low misidentification rate for quarks and gluons
is thus essential to maximize the significance of searches for new physics at
CMS.

Tau leptons are unique in that they are the only type of leptons which are heavy
enough to decay to hadrons.  The hadronic decays compose approximately 65\% of
all tau decays, the remainder being split nearly evenly between $\tau^{-} \to
\mu^{-} \bar \nu_\mu \nu_\tau$ and $\tau^{-} \to e^{-} \bar \nu_e \nu_\tau$.
The hadronic decays are typically composed of one or three charged pions and
zero to two neutral pions.  The neutral pions decay almost instantaneously to
pairs of photons.

In this chapter, we describe a technique to identify hadronic tau decays.  Tau
decays to electrons and muons are difficult to distinguish from prompt
production of electrons and
muons in $pp$ collisions.  Analyses that use exclusively
non--hadronically decaying taus typically require that the leptonic ($e,\mu$)
decays be of opposite flavor.  The discrimination of hadronic tau decays from
electrons and muons is described in~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-08-001}.  With the Tau Neural
Classifier, we aim to improve the discrimination of true hadronic tau decays
from quark and gluon jets using a neural network approach.

\section{Geometric Tau Identification Algorithms}

The tau identification strategies used in previously published CMS analyses are
fully described in~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-08-001}.  A summary of the basic methods
and strategies is given here. There are two primary methods for selecting
objects used to reconstruct tau leptons.  The CaloTau algorithm uses tracks
reconstructed by the tracker and clusters of hits in the electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeter.  The other method (PFTau) uses objects reconstructed by
the CMS particle flow algorithm, which is described
in~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001}.  The particle flow algorithm provides a global and
unique description of every particle (charged hadron, photon, electron, etc.) in
the event; measurements from sub--detectors are combined according to their
measured resolutions to improve energy and angular resolution and reduce double
counting.  The strategies described in this paper use the particle flow objects.

Both methods typically use an ``leading object'' and an isolation requirement to
reject quark and gluon jet background.  Quark and gluon jets are less collimated
and have a higher constituent multiplicity and softer constituent $p_T$ spectrum
than a hadronic tau decay of the same transverse momentum.  The ``leading
track'' requirement is applied by requiring a relatively high momentum object
near the center of the jet; typically a charged track with transverse momentum
greater than 5 GeV/c within $\Delta R < 0.1$ about the center of the jet axis.
The isolation requirement exploits the collimation of true taus by defining an
isolation annulus about the kinematic center of the jet and requiring no
detector activity about a threshold in that annulus.  This approach yields a
misidentification rate of approximately 1\% for QCD backgrounds and a hadronic
tau identification efficiency of approximately 50\%~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-08-001}.

\section{Decay Mode Tau Identification: Motivation}

The tau identification strategy described previously can be extended by
looking at the different hadronic decay modes of the tau individually.
The dominant hadronic decays of taus consist of a one or three charged
$\pi^{\pm}$ mesons and up to two $\pi^0$ mesons and are enumerated in
table~\ref{tab:decay_modes}.  The majority of these decays proceed through
intermediate resonances and each of these decay modes maps directly to a tau
final state multiplicity. Each intermediate resonance has a different invariant
mass (see figure~\ref{fig:trueInvMass}).  This implies that the problem of
hadronic tau identification can be re-framed from a global search for
collimated hadrons satisfying the tau mass constraint into a ensemble of
searches for single production of the different hadronic tau decay resonances.
The Tau Neural Classifier algorithm implements this approach using two
complimentary techniques: a method to reconstruct the decay mode and an
ensemble of neural network classifiers used to identify each decay mode
resonance and reject quark and gluon jets with the same final state topology.

\section{The Tau Neural Classifier}

The Tau Neural Classifier algorithm reconstructs the decay mode of the
tau--candidate and then feeds the tau--candidate to a discriminator associated
to that decay mode to make the classification decision.  Each discriminator
therefore maps to a reconstructed decay mode in a one-to-one fashion.  To
optimize the discrimination for each of the different decay modes, the TaNC uses
an ensemble of neural nets.  Each neural net corresponds to one of the dominant
hadronic decay modes of the tau lepton.  These selected hadronic decays
constitute 95\% of all hadronic tau decays.  Tau--candidates with reconstructed
decay modes not in the set of dominant hadronic modes are immediately tagged as
background.
