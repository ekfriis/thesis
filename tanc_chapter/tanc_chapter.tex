\chapter{Tau Identification: The Tau Neural Classifier}
\label{ch:tanc}

\section{Introduction}

High tau identification performance is important for the discovery potential of
many possible new physics signals at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS).  The
Standard Model background rates from true tau leptons are typically the same
order of magnitude as the expected signal rate in many searches for new
physics.  The challenge of doing physics with taus is driven by the rate at
which objects are incorrectly tagged as taus.  In particular, quark and gluon
jets have a significantly higher production cross-section and events where
these objects are incorrectly identified as tau leptons can dominate the
backgrounds of searches for new physics using taus.  Efficient identification
of hadronic tau decays and low misidentification rate for quarks and gluons
is thus essential to maximize the significance of searches for new physics at
CMS.

Tau leptons are unique in that they are the only type of leptons which are heavy
enough to decay to hadrons.  The hadronic decays compose approximately 65\% of
all tau decays, the remainder being split nearly evenly between $\tau^{-} \to
\mu^{-} \overline \nu_\mu \nu_\tau$ and $\tau^{-} \to e^{-} \overline \nu_e \nu_\tau$.
The hadronic decays are typically composed of one or three charged pions and
zero to two neutral pions.  The neutral pions decay almost instantaneously to
pairs of photons.

In this chapter, we describe a technique to identify hadronic tau decays.  Tau
decays to electrons and muons are difficult to distinguish from prompt
production of electrons and
muons in $pp$ collisions.  Analyses that use exclusively
non--hadronically decaying taus typically require that the leptonic ($e,\mu$)
decays be of opposite flavor.  The discrimination of hadronic tau decays from
electrons and muons is described in~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-08-001}.  With the Tau Neural
Classifier, we aim to improve the discrimination of true hadronic tau decays
from quark and gluon jets using a neural network approach.

\section{Geometric Tau Identification Algorithms}

The tau identification strategies used in previously published CMS analyses are
fully described in~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-08-001}.  A summary of the basic methods
and strategies is given here. There are two primary methods for selecting
objects used to reconstruct tau leptons.  The CaloTau algorithm uses tracks
reconstructed by the tracker and clusters of hits in the electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeter.  The other method (PFTau) uses objects reconstructed by
the CMS particle flow algorithm, which is described
in~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001}.  The particle flow algorithm provides a global and
unique description of every particle (charged hadron, photon, electron, etc.) in
the event; measurements from sub--detectors are combined according to their
measured resolutions to improve energy and angular resolution and reduce double
counting.  The strategies described in this paper use the particle flow objects.

Both methods typically use an ``leading object'' and an isolation requirement to
reject quark and gluon jet background.  Quark and gluon jets are less collimated
and have a higher constituent multiplicity and softer constituent $p_T$ spectrum
than a hadronic tau decay of the same transverse momentum.  The ``leading
track'' requirement is applied by requiring a relatively high momentum object
near the center of the jet; typically a charged track with transverse momentum
greater than 5 GeV/c within $\Delta R < 0.1$ about the center of the jet axis.
The isolation requirement exploits the collimation of true taus by defining an
isolation annulus about the kinematic center of the jet and requiring no
detector activity about a threshold in that annulus.  This approach yields a
misidentification rate of approximately 1\% for QCD backgrounds and a hadronic
tau identification efficiency of approximately 50\%~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-08-001}.

\section{Decay Mode Tau Identification: Motivation}

The tau identification strategy described previously can be extended by
looking at the different hadronic decay modes of the tau individually.
The dominant hadronic decays of taus consist of a one or three charged
$\pi^{\pm}$ mesons and up to two $\pi^0$ mesons and are enumerated in
table~\ref{tab:decay_modes}.  The majority of these decays proceed through
intermediate resonances and each of these decay modes maps directly to a tau
final state multiplicity. Each intermediate resonance has a different invariant
mass (see figure~\ref{fig:trueInvMass}).  This implies that the problem of
hadronic tau identification can be re-framed from a global search for
collimated hadrons satisfying the tau mass constraint into a ensemble of
searches for single production of the different hadronic tau decay resonances.
The Tau Neural Classifier algorithm implements this approach using two
complimentary techniques: a method to reconstruct the decay mode and an
ensemble of neural network classifiers used to identify each decay mode
resonance and reject quark and gluon jets with the same final state topology.

\section{The Tau Neural Classifier}

The Tau Neural Classifier algorithm reconstructs the decay mode of the
tau--candidate and then feeds the tau--candidate to a discriminator associated
to that decay mode to make the classification decision.  Each discriminator
therefore maps to a reconstructed decay mode in a one-to-one fashion.  To
optimize the discrimination for each of the different decay modes, the TaNC uses
an ensemble of neural nets.  Each neural net corresponds to one of the dominant
hadronic decay modes of the tau lepton.  These selected hadronic decays
constitute 95\% of all hadronic tau decays.  Tau--candidates with reconstructed
decay modes not in the set of dominant hadronic modes are immediately tagged as
background.

\section{HPS + TaNC: A Hybrid Algorithm}
\label{sec:TauId} The techniques used in the TaNC have been hybridized with
techniques used by the ``Hadrons plus Strips'' (HPS) algorithm.  The combined
algorithm is referred to ``Hadrons plus Strips and Tau Neural Classifier''
(HPS+TaNC) identification algorithm.  The algorithm combines features of
HPS~\cite{CMS_AN_2010-082} and the TaNC algorithm.  Both algorithms are based on
reconstructing individual tau lepton hadronic decay modes, which has been
demonstrated to improve the tau identification performance significantly with
respect to previously used cone isolation based
algorithms~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-10-004}.  The HPS+TaNC algorithm first reconstructs
the hadronic decay mode of the tau, and applies different discriminants based on
the reconstructed decay mode.  Identification of hadronic tau decays by the
HPS+TaNC algorithm proceeds in two stages: first, the hadronic decay mode of the
tau is reconstructed and then different discriminators are applied, based on the
reconstructed decay mode.  In the decay mode reconstruction particular attention
is paid to the reconstruction of neutral pions, which are expected for the
majority of hadronic decay modes.


\subsubsection{Decay mode reconstruction}

The decay mode reconstruction algorithm is seeded by particle--flow jets
reconstructed by the anti--$k_{T}$ algorithm~\cite{AntiKT}.  In order to
reconstruct the decay mode, the algorithm needs to merge photon candidates into
candidate $\pi^0$ mesons.  $\pi^0$ candidates are reconstructed by two
algorithms which are executed concurrently.  The ``combinatoric'' $\pi^0$
algorithm produces a $\pi^0$ candidate for every possible pair of photons within
the jet.  The ``strips'' algorithm clusters photons strips in $\eta-\phi$.  The
results of both algorithms are combined and then ``cleaned'', resolving multiple
hypotheses.  The quality of a $\pi^0$ candidate is determined according to the
following categorical rankings:
\begin{itemize}
\item The $\pi^0$ candidate is in the ECAL barrel region ($|\eta| < 1.5$) 
and has invariant mass $|m_{\gamma \gamma} - m_{\pi^0}| < 0.05~\GeVcc$.
\item The $\pi^0$ candidate is in the ECAL endcap region ($|\eta| > 1.5$)
 and has invariant mass $m_{\gamma \gamma} < 0.2~\GeVcc$.
\item The $\pi^0$ candidate contains two or more photons within an $\eta-\phi$ strip of size $0.05 \times 0.20$.
\item Photons not satisfying any of the other categories are considered as
  unresolved $\pi^0$ candidates in case they have $\pt > 1.0~\GeVc$.
\end{itemize}  
$m_{\pi^0}$ denotes the nominal neutral pion mass~\cite{PDG}.  The choice of the
invariant mass windows in the ECAL endcap and barrel regions is motivated by the
resolution on the $\pi^0$ mass (illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:PFPiZeroRes})
measured in particle--flow commissioning~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-10-002}.  Multiple
$\pi^0$ candidates in the same category are ranked in quality according to the
difference of the reconstructed photon pair mass to the nominal $\pi^0$ mass.
After the $\pi^0$ candidates are ranked, the highest ranked candidate is
selected for the final collection.  The photon constituents of the highest
ranked candidate are removed from remaining $\pi^0$ candidates not yet selected
for the final collection in order to prevent photons from entering more than one
$\pi^0$ candidate.  The rank of remaining $\pi^0$ candidates is reevaluated and
the $\pi^0$ candidate with the next highest rank is selected for the output
collection.  The process is repeated until no more $\pi^0$ candidates are
remaining.

  combinatoric background. Reference:~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-10-002}}
  \label{fig:PFPiZeroRes}
\end{figure}

Once the final collection of $\pi^0$ candidates is determined, tau
reconstruction in the HPS+TaNC algorithm proceeds by building tau candidates
from reconstructed $\pi^0$ candidates and charged hadrons reconstructed by the
particle--flow algorithm.  A combinatoric approach is again employed for the tau
candidate building.  A tau candidate hypothesis is built for every combination
of jet constituents ($\pi^0$ candidates plus charged hadrons) which has a
multiplicity consistent with a hadronic tau decay.  The tau candidates are
ranked analogous to the ranking utilized for the $\pi^0$ reconstruction, but
with the following categorical rankings:
\begin{itemize}
\item In each decay mode category, the tau candidate with the highest neural network output is selected.
\item The tau candidate has unit charge.
\item The tau candidate passes the ``lead pion'' criteria, requiring that there
  is a photon or charged pion candidate with $\pt > 5~\GeVc$.
\item The tau candidate passes the HPS invariant mass and 
  collimation\footnote{The invariant mass of the signal candidates is required
  to be compatible with the resolution for that decay mode.  The collimation
  selection requires the maximum $\Delta R$ between any two signal candidates to
  be less than $2.8/\et$, where \et is the total transverse energy of the signal
  candidates.  A full description is available in~\cite{CMS_AN_2010-082}.}
  requirements.
\end{itemize}  
In case multiple tau candidates satisfy all four categorical requirements,  the
tau candidate with the highest energy sum of charged and neutral pions is
selected as the highest ranking one.

\subsubsection{Hadronic tau discrimination}

The final level of discrimination is performed by an ensemble of neural
networks, with each neural network corresponding to a specific decay mode,
analogously to the method used original TaNC algorithm
(Section~\ref{sec:tanc_nn_training}).  The inputs of each neural network are
different and correspond to the observables (invariant mass, Dalitz masses)
available for its associated decay mode.  The neural networks are trained on
samples simulated $Z \to \TT$ events (``signal'') and QCD di--jet events
selected in the 7~\TeV data collected by CMS in 2010 (``background'').  All of
the tau hypothesis from a given jet reconstructed in data are used for training.
The $Z \to \tau^+\tau^-$ signal sample is generated by PYTHIA~\cite{pythia6_4}
which has been interfaced TAUOLA~\cite{tauola} for the purpose of generating the
tau decays and simulated passed through the ``full'' GEANT~\cite{geant} based
simulation of the CMS detector.  Only tau candidates which have been
reconstructed in a decay mode matching the true decay mode of the tau on
generator level enter the signal training sample.  The neural network
implementation, network layout, and training strategies are the same as in the
original TaNC algorithm described in this chapter.  To account for differences
in the input signal purity and separation power of the neural networks between
decay modes, the outputs of each neural network are transformed according to the
method described in~\cite{CMS_AN_2010-099}.  Multiple working--points,
corresponding to different purities are provided.
